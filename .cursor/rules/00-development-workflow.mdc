# Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow for this application.

## Setup and Installation

1. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables (create `.env` files in both frontend and backend directories)

3. Seed the database (optional):
   ```
   cd backend
   node seed.js
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- Frontend components should be organized by feature
- Backend routes should follow RESTful patterns
- Use service layers for business logic
- Controllers should handle request/response only

### State Management
- Use React Context API for global state
- Local component state for UI-specific state
- API services for data fetching

### API Development
- Define routes in [backend/routes/](mdc:backend/routes/)
- Implement controllers in [backend/controllers/](mdc:backend/controllers/)
- Define models in [backend/models/](mdc:backend/models/)
- Business logic goes in [backend/services/](mdc:backend/services/)

### Testing
- Unit tests should be placed alongside the components they test
- Integration tests in separate test directories
- API tests using REST client or Postman
