# Development Workflow

This project uses a typical full-stack development workflow:

## Setup
1. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application
1. Start the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Building for Production
1. Build the frontend:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. The built files will be in the `frontend/dist` directory, which can be served by a static file server.
