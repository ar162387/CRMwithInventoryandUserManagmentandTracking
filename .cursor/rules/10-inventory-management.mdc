# Inventory Management

This rule outlines the inventory management system, which tracks items, their quantities, and weights.

## Core Components

### Backend

- **Model**: [backend/models/Item.js](mdc:backend/models/Item.js) - Defines the item schema with inventory tracking fields
- **Controller**: [backend/controllers/itemController.js](mdc:backend/controllers/itemController.js) - Handles CRUD operations for items
- **Routes**: [backend/routes/itemRoutes.js](mdc:backend/routes/itemRoutes.js) - API endpoints for item management

### Frontend

- **Item Management**: [frontend/src/pages/Inventory/ItemsPage.jsx](mdc:frontend/src/pages/Inventory/ItemsPage.jsx) - Main interface for managing items
- **Item Forms**: 
  - [frontend/src/pages/Inventory/AddItemModal.jsx](mdc:frontend/src/pages/Inventory/AddItemModal.jsx)
  - [frontend/src/pages/Inventory/EditItemModal.jsx](mdc:frontend/src/pages/Inventory/EditItemModal.jsx)

## Inventory Tracking

### Key Fields
- `shopQuantity`: Available quantity in the shop
- `shopNetWeight`: Available net weight in the shop
- `shopGrossWeight`: Available gross weight in the shop
- `warehouseQuantity`: Quantity in the warehouse
- `warehouseNetWeight`: Net weight in the warehouse
- `warehouseGrossWeight`: Gross weight in the warehouse

### Validation Process
1. When adding items to an invoice, the system checks:
   - If requested quantity <= available shop quantity
   - If requested net weight <= available shop net weight
   - If requested gross weight <= available shop gross weight
2. Real-time validation messages appear if any constraints are violated
3. On invoice creation/editing, inventory is automatically adjusted

## Integration with Invoice System

### Customer Invoices
- When creating a customer invoice in [frontend/src/pages/Customers/GenerateCustomerInvoice.jsx](mdc:frontend/src/pages/Customers/GenerateCustomerInvoice.jsx):
  1. Available inventory is fetched and displayed
  2. When items are added, inventory validation occurs
  3. On invoice save, inventory is reduced

### Vendor Purchases
- When recording vendor purchases, inventory is increased
- Purchases can update both shop and warehouse inventory

## Important Considerations
- Inventory checks must happen in real-time during form input
- Backend validation ensures data integrity
- When editing invoices, inventory adjustments account for original quantities
- Transfers between shop and warehouse are tracked separately
